                    <p>Victoria, capital of British Columbia, sits on the craggy southern end of Vancouver Island. With abundant parkland, it’s known for outdoor activities. The city's British colonial past shows in its Victorian architecture, including stately Craigdarroch Castle mansion. Butchart Gardens, with 55 acres of vivid floral displays, plus statuary, water features and a carousel, is one of many formal gardens  in the city.
                    <br><br>
                    Victoria’s boat-lined Inner Harbour is flanked by the imposing, domed Parliament Buildings, Royal British Columbia Museum and the grande dame Fairmont Empress Hotel, famed for its traditional afternoon tea. Parks scattered throughout the city include historic Thunderbird, site of First Nations totem poles, and the sprawling, amusement-filled Beacon Hill. The city's mild climate makes it a popular destination for biking, hiking, diving, surfing and kayaking. It's also home to contemporary restaurants emphasizing local ingredients.</p>

                    <p>Whistler is a town north of Vancouver, British Columbia, that's home to Whistler Blackcomb, one of the largest ski resorts in North America. Besides skiing and snowboarding, the area offers snowshoeing, tobogganing and ski jumping at the Olympic Park, a venue for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. The hub of Whistler is a compact, chalet-style pedestrian village at the base of Whistler and Blackcomb mountains.
                    <br><br>
                    The village only dates to the 1970s but has sprouted into a popular, self-contained base camp, with high-end international restaurants, shops, hotels and bars lining its main, stone-cobbled walking avenue. While it's most crowded in winter, Whistler is also a summer destination with lush, forested hills for mountain biking and hiking, whitewater rivers for rafting and a number of golf courses. No matter the season, the Peak 2 Peak gondola – among the world’s longest and highest lifts, stretching horizontally between the tops of Whistler and Blackcomb – continues to run.</p>
