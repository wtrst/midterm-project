            <h2 id="h2_home">Welcome to VanTrip,</h2>

            <p id="p_home">this was a midterm project where two students from CICCC (Cornerstone International Community College of Canada) had to create a website with five html pages and add some style using a css file. They had one week to elaborate it and they had to put into practice the techniques learnt along the first two week of the course.

            <br><br>

            The first thing we did when we received the project instructions was to decide the thematic of the website. We wanted to choose an useful topic and we though something to help out some of our friends or family members if they visit us in future.

            <br><br>

            We worked together on the home page and on the design then we splitted the work, two pages for each of us. Most of the time we were together in class and we could talk about our progress, doubts or suggestions, but to make this project more relieved and let us work on our own whenever we had time, we hosted it on GitHub.

            <br><br>

            This has born as a small project, but who knows if in future we can keep working on it and make it bigger.

            <br><br>

            Do not hesitate and visit British Columbia soon ;-)</p>
